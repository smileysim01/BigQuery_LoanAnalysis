# BigQuery_LoanAnalysis

In this project, we studied the geography of loans in WI using BigQuery and made predictions about loan amounts. We combined data from several sources: a public BigQuery dataset describing the geography of US counties, the HDMA loans dataset used previously in a prior project, and pretend loan applications made via a Google form (we made some submissions ourself and then immediately analyzed the results).

Learning objectives:

combine data from a variety of soures to compute results in BigQuery
query live results from a Google form/sheet
perform spatial joins
train and evaluate models using BigQuery
